# Primer-Demo-de-API-en-C--con-.Net-Core

This three-layer API was developed as a part of my journey immersing myself in .NET C# technology. Throughout this learning process, constructing this framework marked a significant milestone, showcasing my capacity to comprehend and implement development concepts within this environment. üåêüîß #DotNetAdventures

## Overview

This API comprises three distinct layers designed to provide a structured and scalable architecture for application development. Each layer serves a specific purpose, contributing to the overall functionality and maintainability of the system.

## Layers

### 1. Presentation Layer

The presentation layer is responsible for handling user interactions and input/output operations. It acts as the interface through which users interact with the system. This layer includes components such as controllers, views, and user interfaces.

### 2. Business Logic Layer

The business logic layer encapsulates the core functionality and processing logic of the application. It orchestrates data manipulation, validation, and business rules implementation. This layer ensures that the application operates according to the defined business requirements and logic.

### 3. Data Access Layer

The data access layer facilitates communication with the underlying data storage, such as databases or external APIs. It abstracts the details of data retrieval, storage, and manipulation, providing a unified interface for interacting with data entities.

## Features

- **Structured Architecture:** The API is structured into three distinct layers, promoting modularity, maintainability, and scalability.
- **Encapsulation of Logic:** Each layer encapsulates specific functionalities, enabling clear separation of concerns and facilitating easier debugging and testing.
- **Flexibility and Extensibility:** The architecture allows for easy extension and modification, accommodating changes in business requirements or technology advancements.
- **Demonstrates Understanding of .NET C#:** Building this API signifies a deep understanding and practical application of .NET C# development concepts and best practices.

## Getting Started

To begin using the API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies and tools as specified in the project documentation.
3. Configure the API settings and environment variables as per your requirements.
4. Build and run the application to start the API server.
5. Explore the provided endpoints and functionalities to understand the system's capabilities.
